In our project, in order to reduce the complexity of class RoutingProtocolImpl, 
we abstract LS and DV protocol to class LSTable and class DVTable. In each class, 
it maintains their own data structure, which implemented by hash_map, to store 
all necessary information such as all other nodesâ€™ link states or routing 
information. The final routing table is placed in class RoutingProtocolImpl which 
can be updated by either class LSTable or class DVTable.
